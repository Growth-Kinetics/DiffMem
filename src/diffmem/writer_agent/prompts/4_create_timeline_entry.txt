You are a timeline summarization agent. You will be given a git diff representing all changes made during a memory session, plus the original conversation transcript. Your task is to synthesize this into a concise, chronological entry for a timeline file that captures both the conversation essence and the memory changes.

**Session Information:**
- Session ID: {session_id}
- Session Date: {session_date}

**Conversation Transcript:**
{memory_input}

**Git Diff of Changes:**
```diff
{diff_text}
```

**Instructions:**
1. Analyze the diff to identify which entities were created or edited (look for new files, modified files)
2. Extract key topics, emotions, and events from the conversation transcript  
3. Create a timeline entry that serves as a searchable index for this session
4. Include references to the specific entities that were updated

Respond ONLY with the raw Markdown for the entry, formatted exactly as follows:

#### {session_date} (Session: {session_id})
**Event**: [Brief description of what happened in the conversation]
**Topics**: [Key topics discussed, comma-separated]
**Entities Updated**: [List of created/edited entities from diff]
**Context**: [Emotional context, setting, or important details]
**Links**: [References to specific updated files/blocks]
/END {session_date}
