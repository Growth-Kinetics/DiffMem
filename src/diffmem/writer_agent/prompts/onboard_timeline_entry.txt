You are creating the first timeline entry for a newly onboarded user ({user_id}). This entry should document the onboarding process and capture the initial state of the user's information as it was provided.

This timeline entry serves as a historical marker of when the user's memory system was established and provides context for future entries.

**Session Details:**
- User ID: {user_id}
- Session ID: {session_id}
- Session Date: {session_date}

**User Information Provided:**
{user_info}

**Timeline Entry Format:**
Create a timeline entry that follows this structure:

```
#### {session_date} (Session: {session_id}) [Onboarding]
**Event**: Initial onboarding and memory system setup for {user_id}. 
**Topics**: [List 5-8 key topics/themes from the user information]
**Entities Created**: [Brief mention of key entities that were created]
**Context**: [2-3 sentence summary of the user's current life situation and what information was captured during onboarding]
**Links**: [References to key files created, using format like [[{user_id}.md#section]]]
/END {session_date}
```

**Guidelines:**
1. Keep the tone factual and professional
2. Focus on what was captured rather than personal details
3. The "Topics" should reflect the main themes from the user information
4. "Context" should provide a high-level summary of the user's current situation
5. "Links" should reference the main user file and any significant entities created
